When you run the .py file, it will prompt you in the console to input the amount of rows/columns. 
This insures that the entered matrix will be a square matrix of X rows and columns.
It will then ask you input each indidivual row, seperating the numbers by putting spaces in between.
It will then output the entered matrix, the left diagonal, the right diagonal, and the absoulute difference.
There will then be a prompt in the console to press enter to exit program.
