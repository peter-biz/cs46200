# Problem #3 - Iris Dataset Visualization
There is no required input for this .py file. Run it(it must be in the same folder that cmd is running from) and it will pop up a Scatter plot window with the data set visualiaztion. 

## Reason why I think this graphical represenation is appropriate: 
I believe this scatter plot is a good way to show off the petal data of the iris dataset because it shows in a clear and readable way the petal length vs petal width by species on the plot.
