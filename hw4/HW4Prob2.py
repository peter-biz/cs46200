# 2.	For this problem, you need to print the backpropagation weight updates for the activation function and loss. 
# You can design your own neural network with your choice of number of hidden layers, learning rate 
# and activation function so that the loss is minimal and the model gives you the best fit.  
# For this problem, you can use pandas, MLP classifier package from sklearn.neural_network or other python package of your choice. 
# Use the housing.csv data set for your analysis where ocean_proximity is your label.
