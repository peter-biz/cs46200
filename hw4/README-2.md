# Problem 2 - HW4 - Backpropagation
There is no required input for this .py file. Run it(it must be in the same folder that cmd is running from) and it will output the weights and loss of each iteration. It displays a summary at the end
of the inital weights, middle weights, and final weights. It also displays the final loss.
The results will be the same each time, if you want it to be random, remove the random_state parameter from the train_test_split function.

## Required packages:
* matplotlib
* numpy
* pandas
* sklearn
